<font color=#FF0000>To avoid false positive conclusions drawn from PCR or read error, we separated biological replicates containing TCRs against the same specificity from different individuals and searched for enrichment of common motifs. Using this method, we could detect enriched motifs in CDR3s that were found within TCRs specific to a given pMHC from multiple individuals, but not in TCRs recognizing unrelated antigens </font>
